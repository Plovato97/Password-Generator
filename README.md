# Password-Generator
## 3rd week's challenge JavaScript based
## On this challenge I used my understanding of basics JavaScript to complete a password generator

# JavaScript
- began with adding variables that are complete with the full function of each prompt if needed to be used once it is called. 
- organized my var to resemble the different categories of each prompt once it is called.
- Began my function variable with proper prompts to be asked after the pressing for the generate password so the input can be recognized to generate a proper password. 
- After I presented a console log so I can understand the proper selection from each confirm and be able to use it for my if statements
- After understanding the true and false statements I then moved to the generation of my password by beginning an If statement that contained a loop that would generate the password according to the initial prompt of password length.

# Generator
- I coded every single instance that the console would portray when the confirms would be answered.
- (specials === false && uppercase === false && pwnumber === false) false to true and true to false etc. Until all instances would be generated. 
- I then created a for loop to continue with the picking of a character until in me the parameter of the initial prompt 1-128 characters. 
- Created the variable charPick and the function that would play out to pick a character at random each loop that was ran. 
- created local password var to combine all past picks to the complete password and out put of the loop
- returned password once the password has fully been generated so it can be displayed again on the generator text.box
